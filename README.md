# ImageSegmentation-KMeansClustering

Image segmentation using K-Means clustering is a technique in computer vision and image processing that involves dividing an image into distinct regions or segments based on the similarity of pixel values. K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can be applied to this task.

Image segmentation using K-Means clustering is relatively simple and can work well for certain types of images where the color or intensity differences between objects or regions are distinct. However, it may not work as effectively for images with complex textures, shading, or overlapping objects, as K-Means does not consider spatial information.
